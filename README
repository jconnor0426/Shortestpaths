#INTRODUCTION#
	This python scripts are designed to be run using python3

#RUNNING THESE PROGRAMS#

	proj3.py: Run the program with python3 supplying a command line argument 
		of the filename for the file containing the input, followed by Source Node
		and the k value for shortest reliable path

		i.e. python3 proj3.py input3.txt A 2


#EXPECTED INPUT#

File containing list of edges to a graph in the format 

#comment line
UD / D
startVertex	endVertex Weight
startVertex	endVertex Weight
startVertex	endVertex Weight
startVertex	endVertex Weight

Each edge should be seperated by newline characters
There should be no lines in the file with no characters on it
There should be one comment line at the start of the file 

#EXPECTED OUTPUT#

The program will output to a file out.txt.
	It will contain the shortest path from the source to each node 
	It will contain the shortest reliable path results 

#Note
	Shortest Reliable Path doesn't work. Hopefully, this will be enough work 
	that you give me some points.
